Summary:

This is a dashboard that shows different insights of the of the first question, "Which state have the best transportation". This dashboard shows that the Northeast has the states with the best transportation. The top right visual shows the correlation between the mean commute times and the state's percentage of the population that use public transit transportation. The top right visual shows a pie chart showing the different percentages of the different modes of transportation while highlighting the transit value to focus on. The lower left visual is a representation of different percentage bins (not exactly a histogram) and the values of the different amounts of the populations that are in the percentage bins. The lower right visual shows the percentage of the states populations that are in each state. This dashboard is interactive and can be changed the different regions, state division, and even done to individual states.

  

Insights and Findings:

*   The Northeast region of the US have to most of the population using public transit transportation, which would make since since that region has the access to the subway systems and the public buses.
*   In New York even though the driving population is at 10,469,093, 5,504,821 still choose to take public transportation as a mode of transportation.
*   Most the states have the same trend of most the population driving; however, Alaska and District of Columbia have different variation than the other states. Alaska has an average 23.9% of the population that walk instead of using public transit, other transportation, carpooling, or even working from home. District of Columbia has an average of 37.4% of the population using public transit. This percentage is more than any other mode of transportation in the state.
*   The top states with the most of the population using the transit systems are in the Mid-Atlantic state division -District Of Columbia(37.4), New Jersey(7.8), and New York(6.5)-
*   The top 5 states of average transit users District Of Columbia(37.4), New Jersey(7.8), and New York(6.5), Massachusetts(6.3), Maryland(3.9)
*   The lowest percentage of transit user are in Kansas at 0.02
*   The state with the highest commute is New Jersey
*   The state with the lowest average commute is Alaska
*   States with larger populations have  around a 25 minute commute time

  

Design:

*   Upper Left: I chose a scatterplot because its easier to see the correlation of two different values.

  

*   Upper Right: I chose a pie chart to represent the percentages in a shape and by category.

  

*   Lower Left: I chose a bar chart to show the quantity of the total population against the transit percentage.

  

*   Lower Right: I chose the map to easily convey the transit percentage by relativity to location.

  

Income and Poverty Dashboard

[https://public.tableau.com/views/USCensusData\_16944833864880/PovDash?:language=en-US&:display\_count=n&:origin=viz\_share\_link](https://public.tableau.com/views/USCensusData_16944833864880/PovDash?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

  


Summary:

This is a dashboard is used to answer question "How does income and poverty look across America?". I chose visualizations that would display information and differences about the median income and the poverty rate of the population. The upper left is a descriptive statistics for the median income of each state using the individual county's median income. This visualization is using the income values of individual county's collectively to show that statistics in the states. The upper left shows the gap in the minimum and maximum poverty rates in each state. The lower left visual show the correlation between the average rate of poverty and the median income by county's with in a state. The lower right shows a difference between the levels of child poverty and poverty rates in each state.

  

Insights and Findings:

*   Show that the lower the poverty rate by county equates
*   to the higher the median income and the higher the poverty rate the lower the median income.
*   Puerto Rico comes in as the “State” that has the highest average poverty rate and the lowest median income.
*   District of Columbia is its own state and county, so it only has only one record of information. It has the highest median income at $70,848 but has a 18% poverty rate.
*   The average poverty rate among the country is around 16% and the average median income for the country is 48,539 which seems low.
*   The county with the highest amount of median income is Loudoun, Virginia at 123,453 with a 4% average poverty rate and Maricao, Puerto Rico has the lowest amount of median income is 12,606 with a 64.2% poverty. This may lead to a thought that the income that poverty rate must be in a relation to how much people are making to provide for their families.
*   When looking at the income per capita against the average poverty rate the numbers change a good bit. The county with the highest median income Falls Church City, Virginia at 65,600 with a 2.7% poverty rate and the county with the lowest median income Maricao, Puerto Rico at 5,878 and the average poverty rate is still 64.2%.

  

Design:

*   Upper Left: I chose the box-and-whisker chart to demonstrate the minimum, maximum, 25% quartile, the median, and the 75% quartile of the median income in each state based on the values of each county in that state.

  

*   Upper Right: I wanted show differences between to minimum and maximum rates of poverty in each state to show the difference between the two. It shows the amount of children that are in poverty above the total population poverty.

  

*   Lower Left: I chose this visualization to show the average poverty rate to the median income showing if there is a correlation.

  

*   Lower Right: I choose this visual to show if the differences between the child poverty and the poverty. Because the was not a way to accurately show how many children are actually effected by in the poverty rate, I compared the two rates to show poverty level is not representing the whole population in poverty and that they maybe households that have either single or multiple adults along with multiple children that are underneath the poverty level.

  

Employment Dashboard

Summary:

This dashboard is a dashboard of my own question, " What do people chose to do for work?". This question was a bit of a obvious one. I wanted to find out how the different professions are performing through out the country and in the south. In 2015, I was working in the service industry and working as a self-employed Uber driver, and I have been working mostly self-employed ever since. The dashboard can also help see the employment gaps even though it would have been nice to have a kind of timeline to see in what months the gaps are really up and down. However it can convey the various gaps just among the employed and unemployed. The lower right visual is a simple way to see the private work versus the public work with in the employed population.

  

Insights and Findings:

*   California, Florida, New York, and Texas have some of the biggest gaps between the employed and unemployed people of the population. 
*   Most of the population work in the professional which means they were employed in management, business, science, and arts.
*   While most people are working in the in professional fields, they are all most are in the private sector.
*   The population of the people that are employed that work in family work is always less 5%.
*   The Midwest and the South regions have the largest averages of the population working in production. This shows that most of the country’s production, transportation, and material movement are in these regions.
*   The Top States with the highest percentage of self-employed people are North Dakota(15.4%), South Dakota (14.1%), Nebraska(13.9%),Kansas(10.7%), and Vermont(10.4%).

  

Design:

*   Upper Left: This visual show the gaps between the employed and unemployed total population. I wanted the lines to emphasize the depth of the gaps between the two categories. With the lines varying in length it shows the difference in the numbers.

  

*   Upper Right: This is a pie chart that shows the percentages of the the employed population work in the different professions. I didn't choose to use the total population because of the other factors in the data like the unemployment rate and percentage of people who chose to be self-employed.

  

*   Lower Left: I chose a bubble chart to show the amount of people who decide to be self-employed by state. The spacing is not right to show all the state names but the biggest circle names show.

  

*   Lower Right: This visual is one of the most simple choices I made to show the a population that works in the public and private sectors.
